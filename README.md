# Picasso Painting
Welcome to my Picasso painting recreation project! This project is my attempt to recreate a famous Picasso painting using only HTML and CSS. It's a fun way for me to explore the possibilities of HTML and CSS while paying homage to one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.

## Features:
#### Pure HTML and CSS: 
The entire Picasso painting is created using only HTML elements and CSS styles. No JavaScript or external libraries were used.
#### CSS Styling: 
I've utilized CSS to style each element of the painting, including shapes, colors, and textures, to mimic the original artwork as closely as possible.
#### Creative Expression: 
While I'm a beginner, I've tried to capture the essence and style of Picasso's artwork, experimenting with abstract forms and vibrant colors.
#### Learning Opportunity: 
Through building this project, I've gained hands-on experience with CSS positioning, gradients, transformations, and other advanced styling techniques.
## Usage:

#### Open in Browser: 
Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the Picasso painting recreation.

#### Explore: 
Feel free to explore the painting, zoom in on different elements, and appreciate the details.

#### Learn: 
Within the CSS file, I've left comments to explain my thought process and the techniques I've used to recreate the painting. Feel free to read through and learn from my experience!

## Contributions:
While this project is primarily a learning exercise for me, I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improvement. If you have any ideas for enhancing the painting's design, or if you spot any issues, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on GitHub.
